# Overwatch-Queue-Tool
An executable which notifies you by email when an Overwatch queue has ended

## HOW IT WORKS

The program works by using text recognition.
It constantly checks the top of your overwatch screen to determine whether you are in a queue.
Once the queue ends an email is sent to your specified account.  

## HOW TO USE

1.) First clone the repository
        
    git clone https://github.com/FeLiNa22/Overwatch-Queue-Tool.git

2.) Then go into the master directory and double click the .exe application

3.) Set your email address (please use a valid one)

4.) Open Overwatch and then click the start button

5.) Tab onto the overwatch screen and then go on with your day
    when the queue ends,  you will be sent an email :)
    
  *Make sure the window for overwatch is the top window (the one your tabbed onto)*
